# Algorithms Test

This project is a collection of C++ implementations and tests for the exercises and concepts covered in the book **Grokking Algorithms** by *Aditya Y. Bhargava*.

## 📘 About the Book

*Grokking Algorithms* is a beginner-friendly introduction to algorithms, featuring clear illustrations and practical examples. This project brings those examples to life using C++, offering hands-on practice with fundamental algorithmic techniques.

## 💻 Project Structure

The project is organized by chapter, with each directory containing:

- Implementations of the algorithms in that chapter
- Corresponding tests to verify correctness

```
